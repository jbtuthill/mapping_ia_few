# Visualizations for IFEWs Data Processing

This folder contains the data analysis and visualizations created for the study "Mapping the Nexus: A County-Level Analysis and Visualization of Iowa's Food-Energy-Water Systems." The visualizations are organized into subfolders based on their purpose and type.

## 1. `vis_png`
This folder contains the output images generated by the scripts in the `vis_scripts` folder. The images provide visual representations of the data and analyses conducted in the study.

### Files:
- `fig10_breakdown_ns.png`: Breakdown of nitrogen surplus contributions.
- `fig11_ns_methods_trends.png`: Trends in nitrogen surplus methods.
- `fig12_ethanol_comp.png`: Ethanol comparison.
- `fig3_comparison_historical_nitrogen_fertilizer_application_rates.png`: Comparison of historical nitrogen fertilizer application rates.
- `fig4_spatial_distribution_CN_FN_GN.png`: Spatial distribution of Chemical Nitrogen (CN), Fixation Nitrogen (FN), and Grain Nitrogen (GN).
- `fig5_spatial_distribution_FN_GN_average_std_dev.png`: Spatial distribution of Fixation Nitrogen (FN) and Grain Nitrogen (GN), including average and standard deviation.
- `fig6_animal_pop_sioux_vs_adair.png`: Animal population comparison between Sioux and Adair counties.
- `fig7_state_level_USDA_vs_IFEWs.png`: State-level comparison of USDA data and IFEWs data.
- `fig8_manure_methods.png`: Manure nitrogen methods.
- `fig9_decadal_variations_ns.png`: Decadal variations in nitrogen surplus.

## 2. `vis_scripts`
This folder contains the Python scripts used to generate the visualizations. The scripts utilize various libraries to create plots and graphs that help illustrate the findings of the study.

### Files:
- `animal_pop_interpolation.py`: Script for interpolating animal population data and plotting comparisons.
- `comparison_historical_nitrogen_fertilizer_application_rates.py`: Script for comparing historical nitrogen fertilizer application rates.
- `ethanol_comparison.py`: Script for comparing ethanol production and usage.
- `manure_nitrogen_methods.py`: Script for visualizing different methods of manure nitrogen calculation.
- `nitrogen_surplus.py`: Script for visualizing nitrogen surplus trends and breakdowns.
- `spatial_distribution_ns_components.py`: Script for visualizing the spatial distribution of nitrogen surplus components.
